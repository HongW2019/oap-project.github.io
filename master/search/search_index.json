Follow steps below on every node of your cluster to set right environment for each machine. Contents Prerequisites Installing OAP Configuration Prerequisites OS Requirements We have tested OAP on Fedora 29 and CentOS 7.6 (kernel-4.18.16). We recommend you use Fedora 29 CentOS 7.6 or above . Besides, for Memkind we recommend you use kernel above 3.10 . Conda Requirements Install Conda on your cluster nodes with below commands and follow the prompts on the installer screens.: $ wget -c https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh $ chmod +x Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh $ bash Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell. To test your installation, run the command conda list in your terminal window. A list of installed packages appears if it has been installed correctly. Installing OAP Dependencies below are required by OAP and all of them are included in OAP Conda package, they will be automatically installed in your cluster when you Conda install OAP. Ensure you have activated environment which you created in the previous steps. Arrow Plasma Memkind Vmemcache HPNL PMDK OneAPI Create a conda environment and install OAP Conda package. $ conda create -n oapenv -y python=3.7 $ conda activate oapenv $ conda install -c conda-forge -c intel -y oap=1.0.0 Once finished steps above, you have completed OAP dependencies installation and OAP building, and will find built OAP jars under $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars Extra Steps for Shuffle Remote PMem Extension If you use one of OAP features -- PMmem Shuffle with RDMA , you need to configure and validate RDMA, please refer to PMem Shuffle for the details.
